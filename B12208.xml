            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Prieſtes and Ieſuiſts here executed vvythin the land, and other that remaine either in priſon, or abrode in corners: are they not al (in a maner) of that Vniuerſitie?

            <p>And the firſt, is, the verie nature and qualitie of<note place="margin">The firſt argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ambition</note> ambition it ſelf, vvhich is ſuch (as you knovv,) that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177533:51"/> it neuer ſtayeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but paſſeth from degre to degre, and the more it obteyneth, the more it coueteth, and the more eſteemeth it ſelf, both vvorthie and able to obteyne. And in our matter that novv vve handle, euen as in vvovvyng, he that ſueth to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for an other, and obteineth her good vvil, ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth eaſilie into conceipt of his ovvn vvorthines therby, and ſo commonlie into hope of ſpeeding him ſelf vvhile he ſpeaketh for his friend: ſo much more in kingdomes: he that ſeeth hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf of povver to put the Crovvne of an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s head, vvil quic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>klie ſtep to the next degre vvhich is, to ſet it of his ovvn, ſeing that alvvaies the charitie of ſuch good men, is vvount to be ſo orderlie, as (according to the precept) it beginneth vvith it ſelf firſt.</p>
            <p>Adde to this, that ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is Ielious, ſuſpitious, and feareful of it ſelf, eſpecialie vvhen it is ioyned vvith a conſcience loaden vvith the guilt of manie crymes, vvherof he vvould be loth to be called to accompt, or be ſubiect to anie man that might by authoritie take reuevv of his life and actions, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould pleaſe him. In vvhich kinde, ſeing my L. of Leyceſter hath ſo much to encreaſe his feare, as before hath bene ſhevved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his vvicked dealin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: it is not like, that euer he vvil put him ſelf to an others ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s courteſie, for paſſing his Audicte in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reckoninges, vvhich he can no vvay anſvver or ſatiſfie: but rather vvil ſtand vpon the groſſe Summe, and general <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> by making him ſelf chiefe Auditour and Maſter of al accomptes for his ovvn parre in this life, hovv ſo euer he do in the next: vvherof ſuch humours haue litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:177533:52"/> And this is for the nature of ambition in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſecond argument may be taken from my L.<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177533:52"/> order and cuſtome of our Realm, and againſt the knovven common ſtile of lavv, accuſtomed to be vſed in ſtatutes of ſuch matter: vvherby he might be able after the deathe of her Ma. to make legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to the Crovvn, anie one baſtard of his ovvn by anie of ſo manie hakneis as he keepeth, affirmi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g it to be the Naturall iſſue of her Maieſtie by him ſelf.

            <p>Fourthlie, vvhen after a tyme thes fetches and deuiſes, began to be diſcouered, he chaunged ſtreight his courſe, and turned to the Papiſtes and Scottiſh faction, pretending the mariage of the Q. in priſon. But yet after this againe, finding therin not ſuch ſucceſſe as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and hauing in the meane ſpace a nevv occaſion offred of baite: he betook him ſelf fiftlie to the, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Huntington: hauing therin (no doubt) as good meaning to him ſelf, as his father had by ioyning vvith Suffolk.

            <p>So that by this vve ſee the diſpoſition of this man bent vvholie to a ſcepter. And albeit in right, title and diſcent of blood (as you ſay) he can iuſtlie clayme neither kingdome nor Cotage

            <p>That is true (quoth the Gentleman) and euident enough in euery mans eye: and therfore no doubt, but that as much is meant againſt her Maieſtie yf occaſion ſerue, as againſt the reſt that holde by the ſame title.

            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:177533:73"/>
            <p>Firſt it is common, and a general rule of our<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon.</note> Engliſh lavves, that no rule, Axiome, or Maxima of lavv (be it neuer ſo general) can touche or binde the Crovvn, except expreſſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion be made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the ſame: for that the king and Crovvn haue great preuiledge and prerogatiue, aboue the ſtate and affayres of ſubiectes, and great differences alovved in pointes of lavv.</p>
            <p>As for example, it is a general and common<note place="margin">The rule of thirds.</note> rule of lavv, that the vvyfe after the deceaſe of her huſband, ſhal enioy the thyrd of his landes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet the Queene ſhal not enioye the third parte of the Crovvn, after the kings death: as vvel appeareth by experience, and is to be ſeene by lavv, Anno. 5. &amp; 21. of Edvvard the third: and<note place="margin">Tennant by cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie.</note> Anno. 9. &amp; 28. of Henrie the ſixte. Alſo it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule, that the huſband ſhal hold his vvyues lands after her death, as tennaunt by courtiſie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe his life, but yet it holdeth not in a kingdom.</p>
            <p>In like maner, it is a general and common rule,<note place="margin">Diuiſion among daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> that if a man die ſeaſed of la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in fee ſimple, hauing daughters and no ſonne: his landes ſhalbe deuided by equal portions among his daughters: vvhich holdeth not in the Crovvn: but rather the eldeſt daughter inheriteth the vvhole, as if ſhe vvere the iſſue male. So alſo it is a common rule of our lavv,<note place="margin">Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</note> that the executour ſhal haue al the goodes and chattels of the teſtatour, but yet not in the Crovvn. And ſo in manie other caſes vvhich might be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is euident that the Crovvn hath priuiledge aboue others, and can be ſubiect to no rule, be it neuer ſo general, except expreſſe mention be made therof in the ſame lavv: as it is not in the former

For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe, it is not credible that they vvould ſo much haue diſperſed their ovvn bloode in other countries, as they did: by giuing their daughters to ſtraungers, and other meanes.

VVhich no doubt (they being vvyſe Princes and ſo neere of the bloode Royal) vvould neuer haue done: yf they had imagined that herebie their iſſue ſhould haue loſt al clayme and title to the Crovvn of England: and therfore it is moſte eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that no ſuch barre vvas then extante or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
            <p>Their fift reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that diuers perſons borne out<note place="margin">The fifte reaſon.

As before the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:177533:75"/> conqueſt is euident in yong Edgar Etheling borne in Hungarie, and thence called home to inherit the Crovvn, by his great vncle king Edvvard the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, vvith ful conſent of the vvhole Realm, the Biſhop of VVorceſter being ſent as Ambaſſador to<note place="margin">Flores hiſt.

            <p>And ſince the conqueſt, it appeareth plainlie in kinge Stephen and kinge Henrie the ſeconde, bothe of them borne out of Engliſh dominions, and of Parentes, that at their birth, vvere not of the Engliſh alleagiaunce: and yet vvere they both admitted to the Crovvn.

            <p>Their ſixt, is of the iudgement and ſentence of K.<note place="margin">The ſixt reaſon.

VVherunto that vviſe and moſte prudent Prince made anſvvere: that if anie ſuch euent ſhould be, it could not be preiudicial to England, being the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger parte, but rather beneficial: for that it ſhould dravve Scotland to Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: that is, the leſſer to the more: euen as in tymes paſte it hapened in Nor mandie, Aquitane, and ſome other Prouinces.

            <p>And thes are ſixe of their principaleſt reaſons, to proue, that neither by the vvordes nor meaning of our common lavves, nor yet by cuſtom or practize of our Realm, an Alien may be debarred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> claime
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:177533:76"/> of his intereſt to the Crovvn, vvhen it falleth to him by rightful diſcent in blood and ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

The Q of Scot. and her ſonne no Aliens.</note> ſonne, they do ad another reaſon or tvvo: therby to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in verie deed to be no Aliens.

            <p>The firſt is, for that Scotland by al Engliſhe men (hovv ſo euer the Scottes denie the ſame) is taken &amp; holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſubiect to Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by vvay of Homage: vvhich manie of their kinges, at diuers tymes haue acknovvledged: &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie, the Q. and her ſonne being borne in Scotland, are not borne out of the aleagiaunce of England, and ſo no forreyners.</p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe or reaſon is, for that the forenamed ſtatute of forreyners in the fyue and tvventie yeare of K. Edvvard the third, is intituled <hi>of thoſe that are borne beyond the ſeas.</hi> And in the bodie of the ſame ſtatute, the doubt is moued of children borne out of Engliſh alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giaunce beyond the ſeas: vvherby cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for that it is a peece of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent land vvithin the ſeas.

In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vvherof it may be, that it vvas accompted of olde, but one dominion or aleagiaunce. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, no man borne therin can be accompted an Alien to England. And this ſhal ſuffice for the firſt point, touching forreine Natiuitie.</p>
            <p>For the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t obiected, vvhich is the<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment againſt the Q. of Scot. and her ſonne vvhich is K.

            <p>So Likevviſe, in the caſe of king Edvvard the<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Fraunce.</note> third his ſucceſſion to Fraunce, in the right of his mother, though he vvere excluded by the general aſſemblie and conſent of their parliamentes: yet he eſteemed not his right extinguiſhed therby: as neither did other kinges of our countrie that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued after him.

For firſt vvhat can be more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, then to giue the Crovvn vnto the heires of Fraunces and Elenore, and not to anie of them ſelues? or vvhat had they offended that their heires ſhould enioye the Crovvn in their right, and not they them ſelues? VVhat yf king Henries children ſhould haue died, vvhiles Ladie Fraunces had bene yet a liue? vvho ſhould haue poſſeſſed the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before her, ſeing her Line vvas next? and yet by this teſtament ſhe could not prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her ſelf to obteine<note place="margin">Adrian Stokes.</note> it.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:177533:83"/> that meanes, to bring the one in diſtruſt and hatred of the other, and conſequentlie the king in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of deſtruction by his ovvn.

            <p>Neither is this anie nevv deuice of my Lord of Leyceſter, to dravv men for his ovvn gaine, into daunger &amp; hatred vvith the ſtate, vnder other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. For I could tel you diuers ſtories and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemes of his cunning in this kinde, and the one far different from the other in deuice: but yet al to one end. I haue a friend yet liuing, that vvas tovvardes the olde Earle of Arundel, in good credit, and by that meanes had occaſion to deal vvith the late Duke of Norfolke in his chiefeſt affaires before his troubles. This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vvount to report ſtraunge thinges from the Dukes ovvn mouth, of my Lord<note place="margin">Leyceſter cunning deuice for ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvvi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forke.</note> of Leyceſters moſte treacherous dealing tovvardes him for gayning of his blood, as after apeared: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Duke vvhen he reported the ſame, miſtruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not ſo much my Lordes malice therin. But the ſumme of al, is this in effect: that Leyceſter hauing a ſecret deſire, to pul dovvn the ſaid Duke, to the end that he might haue no man aboue him ſelfe, to hinder him in that vvhich he moſte deſireth: by a thovvſand cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning deuiſes drevv in the Duke to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:177533:84"/> cogitation of that mariage vvyth the Q. of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, vvhich aftervvard vvas the cauſe or occaſion of his ruine. And he behaued him ſelf ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſlie in this drift, by ſetting on the Duke on the<note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie of Iudas.</note> one ſide, and intrapping him on the other: as Iudas him ſelf neuer played his parte more cunninglie, vvhen he ſupped vvyth his maſter, and ſet him ſelf ſo nere, as he dipped his ſpoone in the ſame diſhe, &amp; durſt before others aſke, vvho ſhould betraye him? meaning that night, to do it him ſelf, as he ſhevved ſoone after ſupper, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vvyth a band of conſpiratours, and vvyth a courteous kiſſe deliuered his perſon, into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vvel knevv to thirſt after his blood</p>
            <p>The very like did the Erle of Leyceſter vvyth the Duke of Norfolk for the arte of treaſon, though in the parties betrayed ther vvere great difference of innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie. Namely at one time, vvhen her Ma. vvas at Baſing in Hampſhire, &amp; the Duke atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded their lo haue audience, vvyth great indifferencie in him ſelf, to folovv or leaue of, his ſute for mariage: (for<note place="margin">The ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Leiceſ to the D. of Norfolk.</note> that novv he began to ſuſpect, her Ma. liked not greatlie therof:) my Lord of Leiceſter came to him, and counſayled him in anie caſe to perſeuere &amp; not to relent, aſſuring him vvyth manie othes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, that her Ma. muſt &amp; ſhould be brought to alovv therof, vvhether ſhe vvould or no, and that him ſelf vvould ſcale that purpoſe vvyth his blood. Neither vvas it to be ſuffred that her Ma. ſhould haue her vvil herein: vvyth manie other like ſpeaches to this purpoſe: vvhich the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated againe then preſentlie to my ſaid friend: vvyth often laying his hand vpon his boſome and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:177533:84"/> ſaing: I haue here vvhich aſſureth me ſufficientlie of the fidelitie of my L. of Leyceſter: meaning not onlie the foreſaid ſpeeches, but alſo diuers letters vvhich he had vvriten to the Duke of that effect,<note place="margin">Ley. cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynage of the Quene.</note> as likevviſe he had done to ſome other perſon of more importaunce in the Realm: vvhich matter comming aftervvard to light, he couſyned moſt notablie her Ma. by ſhevving her a reformed copie of the ſaid letter, for the letter it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But novv hovv vvel he performed his promis, in dealing vvyth her Ma. for the Duke, or againſt the Duke in this matter, her highnes can beſt tel, and the euent it ſelf ſhevved. For the Duke being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſoone after to her Ma. ſpeech, at an other place, and receyuing a far other anſvvere then he had in hope conceyued vpon Leyceſter promiſſes: retired him ſelf to London, vvhere the ſame night folovving he receyued letters both from Leyceſter,<note place="margin">The Duke of Norfolks flyi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g into Norfolk.</note> and Syr Nicholas Throgmarton, vpon Leyceſters inſtigation (for they vvere at that tyme both frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and of a faction,) that he ſhould preſentlie flee into Norfolk as he did, vvhich vvas the laſt and final complement of al Leyceſters former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, vvherby to plunge his friende ouer the eares in ſuſpition and diſgrace, in ſuch ſorte, as he ſhould neuer be able to dravv him ſelf out of the ditch againe, as indeed he vvas not, but died in the ſame.</p>
            <p>And herein you ſee alſo the ſame ſubbtile &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauilian<note place="margin">Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellian Sleyghtes</note> ſleight, vvhich Imentioned before, of dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing men to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt ſomevvhat, vvherby they may incur daunger or remaine in perpetual ſuſpition or diſgrace. And this practize he hath long vſed, and doth daylie, againſt ſuch as he hath vvil

To vvhich intent &amp; moſte diueliſhe drift perteyned (I doubt not) yf the matter vvere duelie examined, the late interception of letters in Paris from one Aldred of Lyons then in Rome, to Henrie Vmpton, ſeruaunt to Sir Chriſtopher, in vvhich letters, Sir Chriſtopher is reported to be of ſuch credit and ſpecial fauour in Rome, as if he vvere the greateſt Papiſt in England.</p>

            <p>It may be, that her Ma. is brought into the ſame opinion of my L. of Huntingtons fidelitie, as Iulius<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction.</note> Caeſar vvas of Marcus Brutus, his deareſt obliged friend: of vvhos ambitious practiſes, and aſpiring, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Caeſar vvas aduertiſed, by his careful frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: he anſvvered, that he vvel knevv Brutus to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, but I am ſure (quoth he) that my Brutus vvil neuer atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt anie thing for the Empire, vvhile Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar lyueth: and after my death, let him ſhift for the ſame among others, as he can.

            <p>I am of your opinion (quoth the Gentleman) in that, for I haue ſene the experience therof, and al the vvorld beholdeth the ſame at this day, in al the<note place="margin">Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> countries of Germanie, Polonia, Boemland, and Hungarie: vvher a litle bearing of th'one vvyth th'other, hath vvrought them much eaſe, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued them a peace, vvherof al Europe beſides, hath admiration and enuie.

            <p>But vvhat meaneth this ſo much inculcating of

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: is far nearer ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d then is expected or ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>And therfore, for preuention of thes calamities, to tell you plainlie mine opinion (good Sirs) and thervvyth to dravv to an end of this our confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (for it vvaxeth late:) I vvould think it the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point of al for her Ma. to cal his Lordſhip to accompt among other, and to ſee vvhat other<note place="margin">Leyceſter to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</note> men could ſay againſt him, at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthe, after ſo manie yeares of his ſole accuſing and purſueing of others.

            <p>I ſay it vvould be profitable to her Ma. and to the Realm, not onlie in reſpect of the manie daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, hereby to be auoided, vvhich are like to enſue moſt certenlie, if his courſes be ſtil permitted: but alſo, for that her Maieſtie ſhal by this, deliuer her ſelf, from that general

            <p>And hereof vve haue examples of ſundrie Princes, in al ages and countries: vvhos exorbitant fauour to ſome vvicked ſubiect that abuſed the ſame: hath bene the cauſe of great daunger and ruyn: the ſinnes of the fauorit, being returned, and reuenged, vpon the fauourer. As in the hiſtorie of the Grecians is declared, by occaſion of the pitiful<note place="margin">The death of K.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:177533:95"/> folovveth but his ovvn paſſion and ſenſualitie: let paſſe Attalus, and made their reuenge vpon the blood and life of the king him ſelf, by one Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,<note place="margin">Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias.</note> ſuborned for that purpoſe, in the mariage day of the kings ovvn daughter.</p>
            <p>Great ſtore of like examples might be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, out of the ſtories of other countries, nothing being more vſual or freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g al nations, then the afflictions of Realmes and kingedomes, and the ouerthrovv of Princes and great potentates them ſelues, by their to much affection, tovvardes ſome vnvvorthie particular perſons: a thing inded ſo common and ordinarie, as it may vvel ſeme to be the ſpecialeſt rock of al other, vvherat kinges and Princes do make their ſhipvvrackes.</p>
            <p>For if vve loke into the ſtates and Monarchies of al Chriſtendom, and conſider, the ruines that haue bene of anie Prince or ruler vvithin the ſame: vve ſhal finde this point, to haue bene a great and principal parte of the cauſe therof: and in our ovvn ſtate &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, the matter is toto euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

            <p>Sir (quoth the Lavvyer) you aleage great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and verilie I am of opinion, that if her Ma. knevv but the tenth parte of this, vvhich you haue here ſpoken, as alſo her good ſubiectes deſires and complaint in this behalfe: ſhe vvould vvel ſhevv, that her highnes feareth not to permit iuſtice to paſſe vpon Leyceſter, or anie other vvithin her Realm, for ſatiſfaction of her people, vvhat ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſome men may think and report to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, or hovv ſoeuer othervviſe of her ovvne mylde diſpoſition, or good affection tovvardes the perſon, ſhe haue borne vvith him hitherto.

            <p>As to goe no furder, then to the laſt example named and aleaged by your ſelf before: though Queene Margaret the vvife of K.

            <p>And to ſeeke no more examples in this caſe, vve knovv into vvhat fauour and ſpecial grace Sir Edmond Dudley my Lord of Leyceſters good Graundfather vvas crept, vvith king Henrie the ſeuenth, in the later end of his reigne: and vvhat intollerable vvickednes &amp; miſchiefe he vvrought againſte the vvhole Realme, and againſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit particular perſons of the ſame, by the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges &amp; oppreſſions vvhich he practiſed: vvherby though the king receyued great temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie at that tyme, (as her Ma. doth nothing at al, by the preſent extorſions of his nephevv:) yet for iuſtice ſake, &amp; for meere compaſſion tovvardes<note place="margin">The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Dudley.</note> his afflicted ſubiectes, that complained greuouſlie of this iniquitie: that moſte vertuous and vviſe Prince K.

            <p>No doubt (quoth I) but that thes conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt needes vveigh much vvyth anie zelous Prince, and much more vvyth her moſte excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maieſtie: vvhos tender hatt tovvardes her<note place="margin">Her Ma. te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der hart tovvardes the Realm</note> Realm &amp; ſubiectes, is verie vvel knovven of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is not to be thought alſo but that her highnes hath intelligence of diuers of thes matters aleaged, though not perhaps of al. But vvhat vvould you

You haue deſcribed my Lord before to be a great man, ſtronglie furniſhed and fortyfyed for al euentes. VVhat yf it be not ſecure to barck at the Beare that is ſo vvel I brytched? I ſpeake vnto you but that vvhich I heare in Cambrige and other places, vvher I haue paſſed: vvhere euerie mans opinion is, that her Maieſtie ſtandeth not in free choyſe to doe vvhat her ſelf beſt lyketh in that caſe, at this daye.</p>

For conſidering vvith him ſelf vvhat he hath done: and that it is impoſſible in trueth that euer her Maieſtie ſhould loue him againe, or truſt him after ſo manie trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, as he vvel knovveth are come to her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnderſtanding: he thinketh that he hath no vvay of ſure ſtanding, but by terrour, and opinion of his puiſſaunt greatnes: vvherby he vvould hold her Maieſtie, and the Realm in thraldom, as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did in his tyme before him: And then for that

Moſte certaine it is, that he is ſtrong by the preſent fauour of the Prince, (as hath bene ſhevved before) in reſpect vvherof, he is admitted alſo as chiefe patron of the Huntington faction, though neither loued nor greatlie truſted of the ſame: but let her Maieſtie once turne her countenaunce a ſide from him, in good earneſt, and ſpeake but the vvord onlie, that iuſtice ſhal take place againſt him: and I vvil vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake vvith gadging of both my life and litle landes that God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, that vvithout ſturre or trouble, or anie daunger in the vvorld, the Beare<note place="margin">An offer made for taking &amp; tyeig the Beare.</note> ſhalbe taken to her Maieſties hand, &amp; faſt chained to a ſtake, vvith mouzele cord, collar &amp; ring, and al other thinges neceſſarie: ſo that her Maieſtie ſhal bate him at her pleaſure, vvithout al daunger of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng,

            <p>For (Syrs) you muſt not think, that this man holdeth anie thing abrode in the Realme, but by violence, and that onlie vpon her Maieſties fauour and countenaunce tovvardes him.

So that, from his anceſtours, this Lord receyueth neither honour nor honeſtie, but onlie ſucceſſion of treaſon and infamie.</p>
            <p>And yet in him ſelf hath he much leſſe of good, vvhervvith to procure him ſelf loue or credit among men, then thes anceſtoures of his had: he being a man vvholie abandonned of humane vertue, and deuoted to vvickednes, vvhich maketh men odible both to God and man.
